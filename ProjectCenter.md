## Project 1: Sentiment Analysis
### Presented by Victoria Sukar with major contributions from Jeff Thomas and Jerock Kalala

For Project 1, we utilized [Yelp](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) and [Amazon review data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) from Kaggle that was used to analyze the [sentiment](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/) of review responses to determine whether the review is overall positive, neutral or negative. Our overall business problem was to determine if customers of restaurants and purchased merchandise are more likely to post a review after a positive experience or a negative experience. Overall, between the Amazon and Yelp data, we found that most people who post restaurant and merchandise reviews are doing so because they had an overall positive experience.
