This site will serve as my "go-to" website for all things data science and coding moving forward. On the "Project Center" tab you will find all my of DSC450 Projects that are required for graduation. Feel free to click around and I'd love feedback on how to make my webpage more appealing and user friendly as well as what you think about my team projects!
